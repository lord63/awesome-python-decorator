# Awesome Python Decorator

> A curated list of awesome python decorator resources.

## You don't know decorator

Here are some resources about the python decorators.

- [PEP 0318 -- Decorators for Functions and Methods](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0318/)
- [PEP 3129 -- Class Decorators](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3129/)
- [Python Wiki - PythonDecorators](https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonDecorators) This page largely documents the
history of the process of adding decorators to Python.
- [Python Wiki - PythonDecoratorLibrary](https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonDecoratorLibrary) This page is meant
to be a central repository of decorator code pieces. Lots of decorator examples, really cool!

## Built-in python decorator

- [@abc.abstractmethod](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/abc.html#abc.abstractmethod) A decorator indicating
abstract methods.
- [@abc.abstractproperty](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/abc.html#abc.abstractproperty) A subclass of the built-in
`property()`, indicating an abstract property.
- [@asyncio.coroutine](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/asyncio-task.html#asyncio.coroutine) Decorator to mark
generator-based coroutines. New in version 3.4.
- [@atexit.register](https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/atexit.html#atexit.register) Register func as a function to
be executed at termination.
- [@classmethod](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/functions.html#classmethod) Return a class method for function.
- [@contextlib.contextmanager](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/contextlib.html#contextlib.contextmanager) Define a
factory function for with statement context managers, without needing to create a class or separate `__enter__()` and
`__exit__()` methods.
- [@functools.lru_cache](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/functools.html#functools.lru_cache) Decorator to wrap a
function with a memoizing callable that saves up to the maxsize most recent calls. It can save time when an expensive
or I/O bound function is periodically called with the same arguments. New in python 3.2.
- [@functools.singledispatch](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/functools.html#functools.singledispatch) Transforms
a function into a single-dispatch generic function. New in python 3.4.
- [@functools.total_ordering](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/functools.html#functools.total_ordering) Given a
class defining one or more rich comparison ordering methods, this class decorator supplies the rest.
- [@functools.wraps](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/functools.html#functools.wraps) This is a convenience function
for invoking update_wrapper() as a function decorator when defining a wrapper function.
- [@property](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/functions.html#property) Return a property attribute.
- [@staticmethod](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/functions.html#staticmethod) Return a static method for function.
- [@types.coroutine](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/types.html#types.coroutine) This function transforms a
generator function into a coroutine function which returns a generator-based coroutine. New in python 3.5.
- [@unittest.mock.patch](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/unittest.mock.html#unittest.mock.patch) Acts as a function
decorator, class decorator or a context manager. Inside the body of the function or with statement, the target is
patched with a new object. When the function/with statement exits the patch is undone. New in python 3.3.
- [@unittest.mock.patch.dict](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/unittest.mock.html#unittest.mock.patch.dict)
Patch a dictionary, or dictionary like object, and restore the dictionary to its original state after the test.
New in python 3.3.
- [@unittest.mock.patch.multiple](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/unittest.mock.html#unittest.mock.patch.multiple)
Perform multiple patches in a single call. New in python 3.3.
- [@unittest.mock.patch.object](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/unittest.mock.html#unittest.mock.patch.object)
Patch the named member (attribute) on an object (target) with a mock object. New in python 3.3.

## Python decorator in the wild

Once you know the basics of how to use a decorator, you can take a look at some real projects to see how people use
decorators in real life.

- [cached-property](https://github.com/pydanny/cached-property) A decorator for caching properties in classes.
- [cachetools](https://github.com/tkem/cachetools) This module provides various memoizing collections and decorators,
including variants of the Python 3 Standard Library @lru_cache function decorator.
- [celery](https://github.com/celery/celery) Celery is a distributed task queue, it uses decorator to create tasks.
- [click](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/click) Click is a Python package for creating beautiful command line interfaces,
based on declaring commands through decorators. You can also check out the
[autocommand](https://github.com/Lucretiel/autocommand) library which shares a similar idea with click.
- [deco](https://github.com/alex-sherman/deco) A simplified parallel computing model for Python. DECO automatically
parallelizes Python programs, and requires minimal modifications to existing serial programs.
- [decorator](https://github.com/micheles/decorator) This is your best option if you want to preserve the signature of
decorated functions in a consistent way across Python releases.
- [flask](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask) Flask is a micro web framework in python, which uses decorators to route
the URL, register error handler, register processor and so on.
- [flask-login](https://github.com/maxcountryman/flask-login) Flask-Login provides user session management for Flask.
For example, it use the `login_required` decorator to protect some views that need the user to be logged in.
- [GB2260.py](https://github.com/cn/GB2260.py) This project is used to look up Chinese administrative divisions. It
uses decorators to write Python 2.x and 3.x compatible code.
- [marshmallow](https://github.com/marshmallow-code/marshmallow) A lightweight library for converting complex objects
to and from simple Python datatypes. It use decorators to register schema pre-processing and post-processing methods.
- [me-api](https://github.com/lord63/me-api) An extensible, personal API with custom integrations. It uses a decorator
to make sure there is an access_token in the configuration file before sending the API request and reject another
authentication if there is already an access_token.
- [lettuce](https://github.com/gabrielfalcao/lettuce) Lettuce is a BDD tool for python. It uses `step` and `steps` to
decorate functions and classes so they become new step definitions.
- [profilehooks](https://github.com/mgedmin/profilehooks) Python decorators for profiling/tracing/timing a single
function.
- [pypi-cli](https://github.com/sloria/pypi-cli) pypi-cli is a command-line interface to the Python Package Index.
It use decorator to makes a property lazy-evaluated.
- [py-spin](https://github.com/lord63/py-spin) py-spin is a terminal spinner package for python. Yes, it does use a
decorator to register a function that needs to take a long time to finish, as well as showing a spinner while it's
processing!
- [python-goto](https://github.com/snoack/python-goto) A function decorator that rewrites the bytecode, enabling goto
in python.
- [showme](https://github.com/kennethreitz/showme) ShowMe is a simple set of extremely useful function decorators for Python.
It allows you to view trace information, execution time, cputime, and function documentation.
- [tenacity](https://github.com/jd/tenacity) Simplifies the task of adding retry behavior to just about anything. It originates from a fork of [retrying](https://github.com/rholder/retrying).
- [timeout-decorator](https://github.com/pnpnpn/timeout-decorator) Timeout decorator for Python which uses a decorator
to limit the execution time of the given function.
- [Tomorrow](https://github.com/madisonmay/Tomorrow) Tomorrow use decorator to do the magic that let you write
asynchronous code with ease.
- [wrapt](https://github.com/GrahamDumpleton/wrapt) A Python module for decorators, wrappers and monkey patching.
